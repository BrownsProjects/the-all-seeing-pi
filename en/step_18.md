## The All Seeing Pi (Overlay Functions)

The following sections are for more advanced learners as they explains in detail what the code and functions inside `overlay_functions.py` do. It is possible to make the All Seeing Pi without understanding what these functions do - simply save a copy of the file [overlay_functions.py](resources/overlay_functions.py) into the folder with your code and they will be available.
